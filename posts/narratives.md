## Testing Election Narratives
### December 10th, 2020


## Summary of Narrative
Much was made of President-elect Biden's performance in the suburbs during this election cycle, where it was argued that he was able to make up ground in areas that Clinton was not able to win, and that his performances in these areas led him to victory. In fact, there may be evidence to support this narrative. Biden was able to win Nebraska's second district, which includes most of the suburbs of Omaha, while Clinton was not. Similarly, he won in Arizona when Clinton was not, and although Arizona has a substantial urban population, the suburbs around Phoenix are also highly populated. The idea behind exploring Biden's suburban performance is to compare to how he performed in cities to see which area truly drove his victory. 

## Implications of the Narrative
Placing particular emphasis on the suburbs ignores the effects of high turnout in cities that helped to drive Biden's victory, particularly in the industrial midwest. In Michigan, 12 counties, largely suburban, exurban, and rural, voted for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. Biden only won one of those counties. However, (***did Biden do better in Detroit and surrounding areas?***). 

Explore Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, the five states that Biden flipped.
