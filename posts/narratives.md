## Testing Election Narratives
### December 10th, 2020


## Summary of Narrative
Much was made of President-elect Biden's performance in the suburbs during this election cycle, where it was argued that he was able to make up ground in areas that Clinton was not able to win, and that his performances in these areas led him to victory. In fact, there may be evidence to support this narrative. Biden was able to win Nebraska's second district, which includes most of the suburbs of Omaha, while Clinton was not. Similarly, he won in Arizona when Clinton was not, and although Arizona has a substantial urban population, the suburbs around Phoenix are also highly populated. The idea behind exploring Biden's suburban performance is to compare to how he performed in cities to see which area truly drove his victory. Certainly it is a combination of both, but a focus on suburban performance, where Republicans have had advantages in some states in recent history, distracts from a focus on urban performance, and if that it truly what drove Biden's victory, then that may be relevant for future elections.

## Implications of the Narrative
Placing particular emphasis on the suburbs diminishes the effects of high turnout in cities that helped to drive Biden's victory, particularly in the industrial midwest. For example, in Michigan, 12 counties, largely suburban, exurban, and rural, voted for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. It was widely believed that in order for Biden to have success in the state of Michigan, he would have to win back a number of those counties. Some counties are certainly more rural than others, and those rural counties have been trending toward Republicans fairly consistently over the last few elections, only accelerated by Trump's performance; therefore, it was probably unlikely to expect Biden to win a majority of these counties, but one might naively expect that he could win a few. As it turns out, Biden only won one of those counties, Saginaw County. This county is largely suburban, which may provide evidence in favor of the suburbs being a main cause of Biden's victory. The implications of this would be that, for the Democratic candidate in 2024 to win in Michigan, it might make sense for them to care about the success of the candidate in suburbs in the midwest. However, if it was the case that Biden happened to substantially outperform Clinton in Wayne county, the largest urban area of the state, then this might be evidence in favor of cities being the key cause behind Biden's victory. Though it may have not been the case that increased turnout in this election made it so Democrats performed better (as some research may have previously suggested), it is still reasonable to assume that increased turnout in cities in particular would drive up Democratic vote share. Non-voters or occasional voters tend to be lower on the socioeconomic spectrum and poorer voters, on aggregate, tend to vote for Democratic candiates more often; in cities, there is often a higher rate of poorer or working class people than in suburbs for example. Therefore, if there were a substantial "get-out-the-vote" effort to mobilize urban voters, it would make sense that this would substantially increase the margins by which the Democratic candidate would win in an urban area. In the case of Michigan Biden and Clinton performed virtually the same as far as two-party popular vote share is concerned in Wayne County (which is where Detroit is), meaning in this case, it is hard to come to the conclusion that Biden's urban performance is what improved his performance in Michigan relative to Clinton. The broader point, however, is that if it were the case that Biden won because he was able to win by large margins in cities, it would make sense for Democratic candidates to invest in cities in order to win, at least in the Midwest. This narrative would also contribute to the growing urban-rural divide seen in our political system; if Democrats find it electorally expedient for them to invest in cities rather than the rest of the state, this division would only grow.
