In order to make predictions about the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election, it makes sense to refer to past elections as a reference point to inform our prior. Specifically, it is worth taking note of which states tend to be the most influential on the outcome of the election and which states are most likely to flip from one party to the other. For example, since 1900, only [twice](https://www.270towin.com/states/Ohio) (1944 & 1960) has a candidate for president lost the state of Ohio but won the presidency. That does not necessarily mean that the outcome of Ohio is predictive of the outcome of the entire election, but it is worth taking into account when building a predictive model. Similarly, trends indicate that it will probably be crucial for President Trump to win Florida if he hopes to win reelection, as the last time a Republican has lost Florida but won the presidency was in [1924](https://www.270towin.com/states/Florida), when our party system looked much different than it does today, as that was an era prior to the New Deal Coalition. Finally, Pennsylvania has the potential to be a possible tipping point state, as indicated by [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/), and its 20 electoral votes are certain to be impactful in this race.
